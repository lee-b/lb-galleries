		<h1>Kintassa Galleries - A Wordpress Plugin</h1>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>

		<p>This plugin provides an easy, intuitive interface for creating
		image galleries/slideshows.  Features include:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Multiple galleries</li>
			<li>Multiple images per gallery</li>
			<li>Titles and other metadata for images</li>
			<li>Gallery size specification at the gallery level -- images
			are automatically resized if necessary</li>
			<li>Choose how to present your gallery from various built-in
			GalleryApplets, including:

				<ul>
					<li>Automated slideshows</li>
					<li>Manual slideshows with prev/next buttons</li>
					<li>Manual slideshows with image numbers.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>GalleryApplets are HTML/PHP template-based, allowing easy
			modification of generated galleries by web designers</li>

			<li>Plugins supported, for custom GalleryApplets to meet future
			or unforeseen needs</li>
		</ul>


		<h2>Installation</h2>

		<p>Installation is straightforward: unpack the archive to your
		wp-plugins folder, and make sure <i>your webserver</i> can write to
		the following subdirectories:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><code>uploads</code></li>
			<li><code>cache</code></li>
		</ul>

		<p>Then, simply enable the "Kintassa Galleries" plugin within
		Wordpress's admin area.</p>


		<h2>Usage</h2>

		<h3>Administration</h3>

		<h4>The Kintassa Galleries Table</h4>

		<p><em>First of all, make sure the plugin is installed and activated.
		To do this, see the Installation section, above.</em></p>

		<ul>
			<li>Log into your wordpress site's admin area</li>
			<li>You should see a "Galleries" option in the menu. Click this
			option. An initially empty table of galleries will be displayed,
			with an Add Gallery button underneath.</li>
			<li>Click the Add Gallery button. This will take you to the Add
			Gallery form.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>The Add Gallery form</h4>

		<p>Simply fill in some basic details about the gallery you'd like to
		setup, and choose the Confirm button. Once you do this, you will be
		able to add images in a separate step.  Add Gallery options are as
		follows:</p>

		<dl>
			<dt>Name</dt>

			<dd>Simply the name of the gallery.  This should be lowercase, and
			all one word, as it's used within the generated webpages of your
			site, to allow individually styling the gallery.</dd>

			<dt>Width and Height</dt>
			
			<dd>These are simply the size of the gallery, in pixels.  Images
			uploaded to the gallery will be shown with the dimensions you use
			here.  Note that it is fine to change these options <em>after</em>
			uploading images -- Kintassa Galleries will adjust image
			dimensions whenever needed.</dd>

			<dt>Display method</dt>
			<dd>
				<dl>
					<dt>Manual slideshow</dt>
					<dd>Displays a gallery with prev and next buttons,
					allowing the user to manually browse through a gallery in
					a pre-determined order.  Images are scrolled from one to
					the next when changing.</dd>

					<dt>Pager slideshow</dt>
					<dd>Displays a gallery with image numbers, allowing the
					user to browse in any order they prefer.  Images are
					scrolled from one to the next when changing.</dd>

					<dt>Slideshow</dt>
					<dd>A fully-automated slideshow which presents new images
					after a short delay.  Images are faded between one and the
					next</dd>
				</dl>
			</dd>
		</dl>


		<h4>Editing a gallery, and finding the table of gallery images</h4>

		<p>Locate the Gallery Table again (see above).  Find the gallery you
		want to edit in the listings. Choose edit on the row of the gallery
		you wish to change.</p>

		<p>From here the options are the same as when adding a new gallery,
		except that you will also see a table of images within the gallery.
		To change gallery options such as the width and height, simply modify
		the settings here, and choose Confirm.</p>

		<h4>Adding images</h4>

		<p>To add a new image to a gallery, edit the gallery (choose edit in
		the main galleries table), then choose Add Image. Options presented
		when adding a new image are as follows:</p>

		<dl>
			<dt>Sort Priority</dt>
			<dd>Provides a quick way of moving an image to a new position.  To
			use it, check the current Sort Orders on the Edit Gallery page,
			and note the number needed to place your image in the correct
			position.  Sort orders begin at 1 (the first image) and ascend to
			the last image, so generally, entering 0 will move the image to
			the top, whilst entering 1000 will move the image to the bottom.
			<em><strong>NOTE:</strong> For most purposes, it is safe to ignore
			this option.</em></dd>

			<dt>Title</dt>
			<dd>Name of the image</dd>

			<dt>Image</dt>
			<dd>Choose the image file you want to upload.  It is safe to
			ignore this option if only editing other options when you've
			already uploaded an image.</dd>

			<dt>Description</dt>
			<dd>This is provided for flexibility, in case you would like to
			add long descriptions to your galleries' images and display them
			via GalleryApplets (plugins), however the default display methods
			do not currently display this field.</dd>
		</dl>

		<h4>Sorting images</h4>

		<p>The image display order within a gallery initially defaults to
		being alphabetical.  Sort buttons (up and down arrows) are provided in
		the gallery image table.  Simply click the up arrow to move an image
		higher, and the down arrow to move an image lower within the list.
		The first image in the list will be displayed initially (and when no
		javascript is available), with the others following in sequence.  Note
		this this can vary depending on the gallery display mode chosen,
		however: some plugins allow users to browse images any order.</p>

		<h3>Inserting galleries into Pages, Posts, and Templates</h3>

		<p><em>Kintassa</em> galleries are very simple to insert once setup in
		the admin area.  Just make note of the gallery ID from the main
		Kintassa Galleries table in the wordpress admin area.  Then, in posts
		or pages, you can simply enter a shortcode to add the gallery using
		that ID number, like so:</p>

		<blockquote><code>[kintassa_gallery id="3"]</code></blockquote>

		<p>In PHP template files (when creating Wordpress themes), you can use
		the <code>kintassa_gallery($id)</code> template tag (function) instead.
		For example:</p>

		<blockquote><code>&lt;?php kintassa_gallery(3) ?&gt;</code></blockquote>

		<p>Would insert the Kintassa Gallery which has id number 3.</p>

		<p>Your gallery will be inserted according to the settings in the
		admin area.  To adjust the width, height, or display method after
		adding a gallery to a page, just change the settings in the admin
		area.  The page will update automatically.</p>
